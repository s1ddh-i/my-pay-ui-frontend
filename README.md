### MyPay – UI Frontend

A modern fintech UI prototype inspired by real-world payment apps.  
Built with a focus on smooth interactions, scroll-based storytelling, and clean visual hierarchy.

### ✨ Features

- Sticky navigation with clean visual hierarchy  
- Hero section with layered gradient + imagery  
- Scroll-driven card stack showcasing key payment use cases  
- Contextual call-to-action buttons per card  
- Calm, trust-focused section after interactions

### 🧠 Design Approach

This project explores how **interaction-heavy sections** (like scroll-based cards) can coexist with
**calm informational sections** without overwhelming the user.

The goal was not to replicate an existing app, but to:
- practice UI storytelling
- balance motion with restraint
- structure a frontend project cleanly using vanilla tools

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
